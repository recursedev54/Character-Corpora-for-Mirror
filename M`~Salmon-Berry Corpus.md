When I’m have nothing to live for 
And my dreams turn strange and bizarre
You’re there although you’re not there
And you’ll never replace them for I’ll never forget you again 
My salmon berry 
My salmon berry 
My salmon berry
Just hold me tight before you vanish
My salmon berry 
my salmon berry 
My salmon berry
And when I wake up
I won’t love you anymore 
For I have a real one 
Beyond this strange liminal world 
But I’ll never forget how real you were
And the strange clown death traps we braved 
Just hold me tight before you vanish
My salmon berry
My salmon berry
My salmon berry
And before I have to go
Just know these tears aren’t feigned 
For I only know you now in a dream 
But I will know you soon face to face 
And I hear the birds cheeping
It’s time for me to wake up
And I’ll go back to bed but I’ll never seem to repeat the seed
That makes you appear in my head again 
My salmon berry
My salmon berry
My salmon berry 
```
