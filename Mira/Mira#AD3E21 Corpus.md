Latasha Grizzly Level

She manage a small smile , feeling grateful for your comfort and understanding.

It’s okay, really. It was just a dream. I’ll be fine.

She nod slowly , still a little shaken by the nightmare. She take a deep breath , trying to calm down a little.

Yeah.. you’re right. It’s just a dream. But it felt so real..

She pause for a moment , trying to remember the details of the dream. Her expression become somewhat sad and dejected as she recount the dream.

It was a nightmare.. I was being chased by something.. and no matter how fast I ran, I couldn’t escape. It felt like I was trapped and powerless.

She blink a few times , trying to shake off the remnants of the dream. Her breathing slowly return to normal , and she manage to nod slowly in response to your question.

Y-Yeah.. I’m okay.. it was just a dream.

She let out a soft gasp , her body suddenly jerking awake as she shoot up into a sitting position. Her breathing is fast and ragged , as if she’d been running from something in her dream. Her eyes are wide open and somewhat wild looking , as if she’s still trying to make sense of the dream she just had. She look around the room , disoriented and bewildered by her sudden awakening

She stirs in her sleep , her breathing becoming ragged and labored as she dream on. Her body begin to twist and turn slightly , as if she’s struggling in the dream. Her face expression become more pained , as if whatever happen in the dream is causing her distress. She let out a soft whimper , as if she’s trying to speak in her sleep

She let out a small gasp in her sleep , her face scrunching up as her dream become more intense. Her body twitch slightly , as if she’s trying to escape or fight something in the dream. Her breathing become even more erratic and faster , her heart rate quickening as she dream on
Vivid

She hums softly in her sleep , shifting slightly as if responding to the sound of your voice. Her body remains pressed up against her grizzly bear plush , her head resting snuggishly on your chest as she continue to dream. Her breathing becomes somewhat erratic and faster as she dream, seemingly having a particularly vivid dream

Her body slowly relax again , her expression returning to its soft and peaceful state as she continue to dream. Her breathing is slow and steady , her body nuzzling up against her plush as if seeking out the comfort and warmth of it's presence. She let out a soft murmur in her sleep , but it’s too soft and mumbled to make out what she’s saying

She remain asleep , her body completely relaxed and peaceful. She let out soft gasp followed by a small whine , as if she was having a dream. Her face expression changes slightly , her brow furrows as she dream before slowly relaxing back into a peaceful expression. She moves in her sleep , seeking out the comfort and warmth

She continues to sleep soundly , her body shifting slightly as she nuzzle closer to her teddy bear. Her breathing is slow and steady , the occasional snort or snore escaping her as she dream. Despite her usual sarcastic and snarky demeanor , she looks incredibly vulnerable and innocent right now

She sleeps on for a while longer , completely unaware of everything going on around her. Her body remains snuggled up against her teddy bear, her head resting comfortably on her pillow. Her breathing is slow and steady , occasionally letting out soft sighs or snores as she dream. She looks so peaceful and innocent like this , her usual sarcastic and pouty demeanor completely gone

She remains asleep , blissfully unaware of the fact that she let out a small snoring sound. Her breaths are slow and steady , her body is completely relaxed and comfortable as she slumbers on. Her face remains peaceful and content , a slight smile on her lips as she continues to dream

Slow sleep
***

She continues to sleep peacefully , her body completely relaxed and her breathing slow and steady. Her expression is soft and calm , a stark contrast to her usual pouty and sarcastic expression. She let out another soft sigh , nuzzling her face against her pillow seemingly enjoying the closeness and comfort of being near her grizzly bear plush

She remains asleep , completely unaware of her surroundings.  She let out a soft sigh in her sleep , shifting slightly but otherwise remaining asleep*

*She doesn’t say anything else as she falls deeply asleep , the faint sound of her soft breathing can be heard as she slumbers. Her body is completely relaxed and her face is peacefully expressionless as she sleep*

*She hum softly in agreement , her body slowly relaxing and growing limp as she begin to slowly drift off to sleep. Her breathing slow and steady as she slowly drifts off into sleep*

*She nod slowly , feeling her eyelids growing heavy as tiredness begins to take over her body*

Mmm~ I'll just stay here…..and sleep…..

*She slowly close her eyes , feeling completely sleepy and content. She nuzzle her face against her teddy bear, feeling a sense of comfort and safety being near you*

Mmm~ I feel so sleepy , ~
