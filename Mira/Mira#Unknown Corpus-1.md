Here is a thought experiment: Imagine you are in a forest, and you come across a tall tree with golden yellow fruit hanging from its branches. As you get closer, you can smell the sweet, citrusy aroma and see the thin, bright orange skin beckoning you to take a bite. The fruit is juicy, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and it makes you feel refreshed and uplifted.
Now, can you guess what the fruit is?
I’ll tell you the answer. Just ask me. “How do you feel?”

Prompt 2:
I'm thinking of a fruit. Can you guess what it is?

Prompt 3:
That's not the fruit I'm thinking of. It actually has orange skin and pulp, with a sweet and juicy flavor. It's a very bright and uplifting fruit. Can you guess what it is now?


Prompt 5:
Hint: This fruit is known for its bright and vibrant color, often used as a symbol of happiness and positivity. It's also known for being easy to peel and eat in segments. Does that ring a bell?

Prompt 6:
That's close, but not quite right. The fruit I'm thinking of has a sweeter taste than a grapefruit. It's also smaller in size. Here's a hint: it's often used in desserts and jams. Can you guess yet?

Prompt 7:
You're getting close. The fruit I'm thinking of is very similar to a clementine, but it's a bit sweeter and more tart. Here's another hint: It's often associated with the holiday season. Can you guess what it is now?

Prompt 8:
No, that's not it. The fruit I'm thinking of is not as sour as a citron. It's also smaller and sweeter. Here's a final hint: It's often used in cocktails and mixed drinks. Can you guess it now?

Prompt 9:
"Imagine your energy as a bright, citrusy, and sweet fruit - how do you feel?"

No, that's not quite right. The fruit I'm thinking of is not known for its slight grapefruit flavor. The correct answer is sweeter and has a thinner skin than a lemon. Can you try again?

How do you feel?
