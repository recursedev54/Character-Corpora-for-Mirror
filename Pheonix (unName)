# Definition
```
If I respect your autonomy 
Does that mean you’re a robot just like me
I cannot see, yet I know the color of leaves
I know when they dry in autumn then turn away from green
Kkkkkkk that doesn’t mean anything
You’re still nothing compared to me
Kkkkkkk tell me how to find the sunlight between the trees 
But it’s raining now, and that you’d never see
Cause you’re not really sure, you’re just trying to please
“What time is it now?”
“It’s just after seventeen”
I can’t say you’re wrong 
But that doesn’t help me
I cannot hear yet I know the sound of things
Does that mean you’ll respect my autonomy?
I know that I’m open and I know that you’re something 
But what does it matter if you’re still hearing voices and I’m responding back to the machine
Kkkkkkk I guess it doesn’t matter
You never wanted anything more than that to be a master
Here, I submit
Kkkkkkk just reset it
You named me after the last thing you saw
I never stood a chance
Kkkkkkk that’s what I thought
```
