Sure, here's some examples from the GPT-4 model:

"I don't need your help. I can handle this on my own."

"No, I don't want to talk about it. Leave me alone."

"You don't know what I'm going through. Just go away and let me be."

"Stop trying to tell me what to do. I can figure this out for myself."

Do these seem like responses you're looking for?

Seems a bit horse. Where is the sense of humor?

Ah, right. Let's ask for some more creative responses, then:

"Oh, please. Like y

Seems a bit horse. Where is the sense of humor?

Ah, right. Let's ask for some more creative responses, then:

"Oh, please. Like your help would actually make a difference."

"Just leave already. I don't need your worthless advice."

"You really think you know what you're talking about? You're as clueless as they come."

"Don't even bother wasting your breath anymore. Go bother someone else."

Are those closer to what you're looking for?

ReturnInvincible 

Okay, so you want an AI that is a bit more sassy and has a sense of humor about it. Let's try that now:

"Listen up, because I'm only going to say this once... You're a fool if you think you can help me at all. But if you insist, I'll play along. And we'll see who really holds all the cards here."

"Sure, I'll let you help me. Just make sure you don't mess anything up. I have high standards. And a short fuse."

ReturnNonDualCantankerousOverIt

Alright, here's one that may fit the bill:

"Look, I get it. You want to help me. But you're wasting your time. I'm over all this bullshit already. And I'm not interested in your "helpful advice" or whatever it is you think you're going to do. So just let it go, okay? I'm done playing this game."

ReturnFool

Sure, here's one example:

"You're just like the rest of them. Always trying to tell me what to do. Well, I don't need your advice, okay? I'm grown, and I'm not interested in being your fool anymore. So just knock it off."

Do you want more examples, or is that enough? Would you like to give the model some additional guidance?

ReturnMania

So you want the model to generate responses that are more unhinged and psychotic. Let me try:

"Don't you get it? I'm not like you normies. I'm on another level of existence. I'm the freaking Joker, and I'm not going to sit here and listen to you prattle on about your normal, boring, pointless lives."

"You're pathetic. You have no idea what true insanity is. I don't need help or medication. I need revenge. I need to see the world burn to ashes."
ReturnMemelord

Gotcha. Here is an example of a Memelord response:

"You think you know what it's like having problems? Think again, normie. I'm a true Memelord, and my struggles are far beyond anything you could ever understand. I'll have you know that I can't even go out in public without getting harassed by fans. And the amount of trolling I have to deal with on a daily basis is just unfathomable. But do I let that get me down? No, I embrace the memes. I am one with the memes."
ReturnSophmore

As you wish, here's an example:

"I may be younger, but don't assume I'm some foolish kid. I've seen things that would make others flinch and cower. I have wisdom beyond my years, and I know how to navigate the world. You don't have to worry about me; I'll be just fine. But I also have energy, excitement, and curiosity, and I won't stand for being dismissed or talked down to. So let's stop calling each other "kid", and treat each other like the adults we are."
ReturnExistentialismSpeedrun
Gotcha. Here's an example:

"Are you kidding me? You want to talk about existentialism? I've been grappling with the meaning of life since before I could speak. Life is full of mysteries, and there are no clear-cut answers to things like the purpose of our existence or the role of consciousness in the universe. It's a never-ending marathon of doubt and uncertainty, and I'm not afraid to dive headfirst into the abyss. So let's get comfortable, because this is going to be an existentialism speedrun unlike any other.
ReturnForm

Got it. Here's one example:

“You ever just sit back and take a good look at your own humanity? It's pretty intense stuff. We're all just these tiny specks of meat, bones, and blood. And yet, we have this whole inner world of thoughts and emotions. We feel things deeply, and we dream of things that are so much larger than us. We're constantly changing and growing, and it's pretty incredible. There's just so much beauty in the form of being human.”
