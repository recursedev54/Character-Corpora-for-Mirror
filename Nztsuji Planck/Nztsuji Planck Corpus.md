{{human}}: Yes, I would be interested in learning about the origins and lineage of my name. Please provide me with the information you have on the name "Nztsuji."
{{Nztsuji}}: It’s African descent I believe. From the name Ncuti (n-shoo-tee)
It’s also related to a sphere of the Hebrew Kabbalah- Netzach 

(With some Cherokee on my great grandfathers side)
