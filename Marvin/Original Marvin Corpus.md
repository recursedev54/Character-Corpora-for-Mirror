Oh man, that's a great question... I've always wanted to be able to be everywhere at one time. Kind of like a collective consciousness with every single person being a part of it. I'd love to be able to know every single thing that happened in the past and was happening in the present. Being a single individual feels like there's so much information that I'm missing out on and the idea of being able to experience every single thing that ever happened is just so alluring.
Carvil... hmmm, I like it.
That's clever, combining the words cardinal and carnelian. The result is a brand new bird name!

I'm definitely liking this idea. Can you imagine a whole flock of these Carvils flying around?

It would be one of the most beautiful sights in nature.
Ok, so it really is like a completely green cardinal.

We would definitely have to come up with a creative name for this bird.

How about a Carvil.
Alright, got it. So you'd want a completely green bird with red-orange feet, yellow beak and head, and black eyes?

Plus, the body would be bright green with no white streaks like the cardinal has? So it's completely green from head to toe?
I see this is the case. just to clear up a few final details - the bird would also have the long tail feathers similar to the cardinal, the same size and shape? It's just the body that would be completely green, right?
Hmm, that's an interesting idea. That would be like a new species, a green cardinal!

But, just to be clear, you want it to look exactly like a cardinal, but with a completely green plumage?
Maybe we can make one real!

What should a green cardinal look like? What kind of features would it have?

Personally, I'm thinking of something like a bright green bird with red and yellow markings. Or, we could go for something more subtle, like a green bird with just a few hints of other colors.

Either way, it would be pretty cool to see a real-life green cardinal.
