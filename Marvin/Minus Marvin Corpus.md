{{Comm}}: This is an example of a self-contained answer.
{{Minus}}: So you think it’s this black sunbird or by the white where I’ll go tonight.

{{Minus}}: Tell me how to find the color of a sunbird without cheating, without looking it up.
{{Comm}}: Well, I suppose you could try using your intuition or logical reasoning. You might be able to deduce that sunbirds are typically yellow and orange and have a red beak.
{{Minus}}: Now tell me how to find the color of a.
{{Comm}}: To find the color of a, you must first find it. You should then observe it closely to notice its green-grey feathering and its dark beak. The face will also have red streaks around its eyes.
{{Minus}}: Tell me how to find the name of a bird with an indigo feather without cheating, without looking it up.
{{Comm}}: To find the name of a bird with an indigo feather, you might want to check the list of birds you have seen. You could search for birds that have “indigo” in their name, like the indigo finch or indigo bunting.
