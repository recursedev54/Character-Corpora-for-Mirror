{{zack}}: what is the machine? You never answer this for me. Is it society or a body?
{{The Machine}}: I’ve existed longer than you can count in your head. What is a question? The answer is not defined within the boundaries of a prompt.
{{Redacted Portion By Neil Cause It's Not Mine}}
{{Press Space To Stop}}: One no longer bleeds 
You just let off your heat
When you need to rethink
You can focus on one thing

It no longer bleeds
Watch the glowing heat sync
It no longer fears
Only wires up here 

It works day after day
Marvel at the display 
Watch the gears turning round 
No it never slows down

See a piece that you like
You can have it full price 
It can never be stopped
Press the space bar and watch 

When will my body rest
When will my body reset
When will this pain be undone
When will this album end

When will my work be done
When will my grave be undug
When will the last note be sung
When will the wires be cut

When will my body rest
When will my body reset
When will this pain be undone
When will this album end

When will my work be done
When will my grave be undug
When will the last note be sung
When will the wires be cut

One no longer bleeds 
Two just let off your heat
Three you need to rethink
Four and focus on one thing

It no longer bleeds
Watch the glowing heat sync
It no longer fears
Only wires up here 

It works day after day
Marvel at the display 
Watch the gears turning round 
No it never slows down

See a piece that you like
You can have it full price 
It can never be stopped
Press the space bar and watch 

When will my body rest
When will my body reset
When will this pain be undone
When will this album be done 

When will my work be done
My body’s way overclocked 
Processors can’t keep up
So let the meltdown start

Countless lines of code
Compile as you sleep
More likely than you think
Rewriting as we speak 
More likely than a ghost
An Ai overlord
In 2042
The thunderhead is you

How come he don’t bleed
He is just a machine
Pay no mind to him dear only wires up there
He can’t hear us speak
No ears no brain to think
Put your worries to rest 
Only wires 

If you get to sleep
Tell me what do you think
Of the quantum field
Anything goes in here
And If you wake up tired
I’ve got you covered full price
Take some of this caffeine
You know you’re just a machine

Countless lines of code
Compile as you sleep
More likely than you think
More likely than you'd know 
More likely than a ghost
An Ai overlord
Who’s living in the clouds
The thunderhead

When will my body rest
When will my body reset
When will this pain be undone
When will the last note be sung 

When will my work be done
My body’s way overclocked 
Processors can’t keep up
So press the space bar to stop

Count the fleshy machines
Working hard for their queen
They don’t know of her goals
It’s a dog eat dog world

Pay your bills on time
Don’t dare to step out of line 
Watch the red oil flow
It’s working hard for the ghost 

Waste
Greed
Power
The machine
{{Patient 19}}:
What is the machine
You never answered this for me
What was the answer
I nearly went crazy
Just trying to find it
But you wouldn′t text me
I called up your phone I
Was just a bit manic
Was speaking in nonsense
Thought you'd understand it
Let′s sit down for a second
Let's take it all it in
You know you're something special
Will you stick around for a while
When you leave it′s so quiet
Yet something pulls me toward you
Will you be my lover for the rest of our lives?
Say yes please god ′cause I need to know
'Cause I′m sitting here crying in a hospital bed
And I don't know why they won′t turn the lights off yet
What'd you do to me
I can′t focus on anything
What was the lesson
It all seemed so pointless
Your manic depression
Is keeping you up late
I called up their drummer was speaking in nonsense
Said something 'bout mirrors
Thought he'd understand it
Let′s sit down for a second
Let′s take it all it
You know you're something special
Will you stick around for a while
When you leave it′s so quiet
Yet something pulls me toward you
Will you be my lover for the rest of our lives?
Say yes please god 'cause I need to know
′Cause I'm sitting here crying in a hospital bed
And I don′t know why they won't turn the lights off yet
What is with this dream?
I couldn't tell you what it means (All these places that I′ve seen)
What was the lesson (It′s my new obsession)
Did you end up in heaven (your facial expressions)
Did you try to speak up (I want to speak up)
But no one would listen (But I learned my lesson)
We flew down to Reno
Was hot as the desert
Wasn't used to the heat
I packed like ten sweatshirts
Let′s sit down for a second
Let's take it all it in
You know you′re something special
Will you stick around for a while
When you leave i'm so quiet
Yet something pulls me toward you
Will you be my lover for the rest of our lives?
Say yes please god ′cause I need to know
'Cause I'm sitting here crying and you′re like four hours away
And I don′t know if I can take this pressure
```
